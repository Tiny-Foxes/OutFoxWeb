<h1>What is Project OutFox?</h1>

<p>Project OutFox is a fork of StepMania 5.1, led by a group of veterans and other prominent figures in the community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Its main goals include:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Refactoring its internal codebase to improve performance, adhere to modern coding practices, and enhance its capabilities on modern hardware and other platforms. We have worked on support for single-board ARM systems such as Raspberry Pi), and improvements to uncapped frame rate have also been recorded on hardware as far back as the Pentium E2180.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Improving its support for other gameplay styles beyond dance games; we are treating the project as a cross-platform "sandbox" and "museum" for rhythm games, rather than simply a simulator/emulator for popular dance game franchises.</li>
</ul>

<p>As Project OutFox is a continuation of the 5.0.12 and 5.1 codebase (not “5.2”), it remains compatible with almost all existing songs, themes, and noteskins that are supported on these versions (if you do encounter odd behaviour or other issues with older content, please report it to us as a bug). Project OutFox is unrelated to 5.1 -3 (sometimes written as 5.1-3), which was a prior build of 5.2 before it was renamed.</p>

<h1>Who develops it?</h1>

<p>It is developed by a team of community veterans and other members of the StepMania community.</p>
