<p>Project OutFox is an overall effort to modernize and revitalize the open source rhythm gaming engine StepMania. It is led by Team Rizu, a development team led by community veteran Squirrel, as well as many other prominent members of the current community.</p>

<p>It was originally conceived as being a complete fork of the engine. However, we have since gained the support of its current lead developer, and are currently working on an experimental branch codenamed "OutFox" – based on version 5.1. OutFox focuses primarily on refactoring low-level portions of the engine in preparation for future development, including code modernization to improve performance, as well as changes to its graphics architecture to provide more complete support for modern hardware.</p>

<p>However, OutFox is only the first stage of our plans: “Serene” is a future project that will significantly refactor the engine to make it a true video game engine for rhythm games, with wide support for various game play styles and input schemes, including touchscreens.</p>

<h1 class="page-title">About Project OutFox</h1>

<p>Project OutFox is a development branch focused primarily on the internal codebase to improve performance, adhere to modern coding practices, and enhance its capabilities on modern hardware and other platforms (including single-board embedded systems such as Raspberry Pi). Improvements to uncapped frame rate have also been recorded on older hardware, as far back as the Pentium E2180. It also incorporates a new default theme with more integrated features than previous versions, and new internal functions that can be used for future content.</p>

<p>As Project OutFox is a continuation of the 5.0.12 and 5.1 codebase (not “5.2”), it remains compatible with almost all existing songs, themes, and noteskins that are supported on these versions (if you do encounter odd behaviour or other issues with older content, please report it to us as a bug).</p>

<p>5.3 is unrelated to 5.1 -3 (sometimes written as 5.1-3), which was a prior build of 5.2 before it was renamed</p>
