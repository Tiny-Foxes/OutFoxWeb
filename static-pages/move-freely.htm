<p>The<strong>&nbsp;OutFox Community Pack Project&nbsp;</strong>is creating new simfiles to be included as part of Project OutFox's default content. This is a non-competitive event, intended to showcase our community and their skills! We are aiming for "libre" content, so that songs from the Community Pack Project can be freely included with our packages.</p>

<p>You can participate as a music artist (by submitting your works), step artist (by creating charts for music submissions) or designer (by creating the graphics for music submissions). You may send multiple submissions. You can also participate on more than one category simultaneously, if you wish. All participants should read and understand the guidelines below before signing up.</p>

<p>The final product for each approved complete submission is:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Music</li>
	<li>Charts</li>
	<li>Graphics</li>
</ol>

<p>Again, you don’t need to submit everything in order to participate. After the initial review to ensure they meet the requirements, all music submissions will be assigned to step artists and designers in order to create their accompanying step charts and graphics.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Chart guidelines</h2>

<ul>

	<li>Multiple step artists can (and should) cooperate on the same music: having different minds work on the same job will get it done faster and improve variety;</li>
	<li>Do what you want: tech, mods, stamina, gimmicky, freestyle, doubles… whatever your heart desires while still keeping a variety of levels;</li>
	<li>You can make charts for all game types: you are not limited to only dance or pump;</li>
	<li>Don’t forget to tell if your step charts are for pad/mat or keyboard/controller play;</li>
	<li>Provide your submissions using the SSC format</li>
</ul>

	<li>The graphics' content can be a maximum of "PG-13" in intensity, but we would recommend keeping things work safe.</li>
</ul>
