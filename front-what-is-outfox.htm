<h1 class="page-title">What is Project OutFox?</h1>

<p><strong>Project OutFox</strong> is a fork of StepMania, focused on modernizing its codebase to improve performance, refurbish neglected code, and introduce new features to the engine, and to improve its support for other styles of rhythm games beyond just dance games to create a cross-platform “sandbox” and “museum” for the genre. It is developed a team of community veterans and other current members of the current community.</p>
